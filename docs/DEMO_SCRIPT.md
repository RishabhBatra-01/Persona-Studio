**[Screen: Show price tags - $200-$500 for professional photography]**

"You either paid hundreds of dollars for a professional photoshoot... or you settled for that selfie you took in your living room."

**[Screen: Show awkward selfie examples]**

"Here's the reality: Professional headshots are expensive, time-consuming, and honestly... a hassle. You need to book appointments, travel to studios, and wait days for results."

**[Lean forward, more direct]**

"But what if I told you there's a better way? A way to get studio-quality headshots in seconds, not days. For free. From anywhere."
