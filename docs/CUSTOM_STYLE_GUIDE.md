## Troubleshooting

**Problem**: Result doesn't match my description
- **Solution**: Be more specific. Add details about lighting, background, and attire.

**Problem**: Can't type in the text box
- **Solution**: Make sure you've clicked the Custom Style card first. The text box only appears when selected.

**Problem**: "Create Magic" button is disabled
- **Solution**: You need to type at least a few words in the custom description box.

**Problem**: Result looks too different from my photo
- **Solution**: The AI preserves your face but changes everything else. If you want minimal changes, use preset styles instead.
